        <h1>An episodic descent into grief and apparition.</h1>
        <p>The film unfolds in three investigations. Each chapter follows DAVID HILL as he confronts a murder, its spectral residue, and the way memory claws at the living. The film employs a threefold episodic structure&mdash;each section shows a murder and its investigation by our stoic protagonist.</p>

          <p>In a seedy motel on the outskirts of town, BELLE is murdered by her boyfriend, ENZO, for money. In her dying vision she sees a tender family reunion, dead relatives welcoming her home. DAVID solves the crime with ease and grows frustrated by its bleak normalcy. After a brief pursuit, ENZO is killed by police; his final vision is something vaguely human in a cheap tuxedo, its painted-on face drifting closer.</p>

          <p class="caption">II. The Strange Case of Norma Agnes Linwood</p>
          <p>Jolted from a fevered nightmare, DAVID responds to NORMA, a middle-aged woman who cannot find her elderly mother. The decaying house mirrors his dream. NORMA is unkempt, terrified, and as the officers depart she stares at an upstairs window in pure horror. Alone, she tends to her mother&rsquo;s hidden, decaying body, applying makeup and brushing her hair each day. When NORMA calls to confess, she hallucinates TUXEDO MAN across from her, seizes, and is hospitalized. DAVID suspects mercy, not malice. Her last words before flatlining: &ldquo;Are you feeling better, mommy?&rdquo;</p>

          <p>DAVID is called to 616 Freeman Avenue &mdash; the BURROW&rsquo;S House he believed burned down decades ago. In the yard rests his dead mother&rsquo;s severed hand, still as young as the day she died thirty years earlier. He steps inside without hesitation, following bloody handprints lining the hall toward a closed door that promises a revelation beyond imagination.</p>
