            <h3>Director's Vision</h3>
            <p>Cinema is made of the fabric of the universe - light, sound, and time. Therefore, it is the perfect art form to tell a story with such existential weight. My approach to filmmaking is a little different than some. My background is in the avant-garde, and so I like to think of a film as something between a moving painting and a symphony. Every single shot must be handled with the same attention to detail that an artist would approach a canvas. Every frame must be a painting. Anything in the frame. From the colors to the lighting, blocking, and movement. can change the mood of an image ever so slightly. Think about how different musical notes fit together to make a chord with its own distinct emotional value. That's a shot - a series of small visual decisions that come together to express a distinct emotion. In music, chords are then arranged amidst other chords to create a piece of music. That is editing, comparing images together to create a fluid and dynamic emotional flow. That is cinema. A visual symphony.</p>
