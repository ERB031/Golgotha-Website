The film employs a threefold episodic structure. Each section

shows a murder and its investigation by our stoic protagonist,

DAVID.

I. The Tragedy of Belle & Enzo
In a seedy motel, on the outskirts of town, a young woman named BELLE is murdered
by her boyfriend, ENZO for money. In her dying vision, she sees what looks like a
family reunion. All her dead relatives appear to be welcoming her back home.

DAVID solves the crime with such ease that he becomes frustrated by the
existential normalcy of this kind of crime.

After a brief pursuit, ENZO is later killed by the police. In his dying vision, he
sees something much more sinister than BELLE. He sees something vaguely human,
with a face that looks as if it were painted on, dressed in a cheap old tuxedo.

Whatever it is, it’s getting closer.

II. The Strange Case of Norma Agnes Linwood
DAVID wakes from a feverish nightmare to a call about a middle-aged woman,
NORMA, who can’t find her elderly mother. He arrives at the scene to find a
weathered old house that bears an uncanny resemblance to the setting of his
nightmare.

It quickly becomes clear that NORMA is mentally unwell. She appears unkempt and
disoriented. DAVID is at once suspicious and sympathetic. As he enters the
house, NORMA looks at an upstairs window in pure horror.
Once the police leave, NORMA heads upstairs, where it is revealed that she is
hiding her MOTHER’s decaying body. Every day, she does her mother’s makeup and
brushes her hair. After a complete mental breakdown, she calls the police again to
confess, but mid-confession, she hallucinates TUXEDO MAN sitting across from her.
She has a seizure and is admitted to the hospital in critical condition.

After the autopsy, an exasperated DAVID suspects that NORMA killed her mother out
of mercy, not malice.

In her hospital bed, NORMA flatlines, her last words are...
"Are you feeling better, Mommy?"

III. David Goes Home
DAVID receives one more call...

A strange occurrence at a stranger house, 616 Freeman Avenue. The BURROW’s
House...

He thinks,

“That place burned down 30 years ago.
”

Apparently not.
He arrives at the scene to something beyond his imagination, his dead mother’s
hand, severed, lying in the grass, still as young as the day she died 30 years

ago.

Without hesitation, he enters the house where he sees a hallway plastered with
bloody handprints, leading to a closed door. He opens the door...to find his mother... or is it?

Director's statement: CINEMA IS MADE OF THE FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE - LIGHT, SOUND, AND TIME. THEREFORE, IT IS THE PERFECT ART FORM TO TELL A STORY WITH SUCH EXISTENTIAL WEIGHT.
MY APPROACH TO FILMMAKING IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SOME. MY BACKGROUND IS IN THE AVANT-GARDE, AND SO I LIKE TO THINK OF A FILM AS SOMETHING BETWEEN A MOVING PAINTING AND A SYMPHONY. EVERY SINGLE SHOT MUST BE HANDLED WITH THE SAME ATTENTION TO DETAIL THAT AN ARTIST WOULD APPROACH A CANVAS. EVERY FRAME MUST BE A PAINTING. ANYTHING IN THE
FRAME. FROM THE COLORS TO THE LIGHTING, BLOCKING, AND MOVEMENT. CAN CHANGE THE MOOD OF AN IMAGE EVER SO SLIGHTLY.
THINK ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT MUSICAL NOTES FIT TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHORD WITH ITS OWN DISTINCT EMOTIONAL VALUE. THAT'S A SHOT - A SERIES OF SMALL VISUAL DECISIONS THAT COME TOGETHER TO EXPRESS A DISTINCT EMOTION. IN MUSIC, CHORDS ARE THEN ARRANGED AMIDST OTHER CHORDS TO CREATE A PIECE OF MUSIC. THAT IS EDITING, COMPARING IMAGES TOGETHER TO CREATE A FLUID AND DYNAMIC EMOTIONAL FLOW. THAT IS CINEMA.
A VISUAL SYMPHONY.
